      <h2 class="title2">2019-20 Off-Ball Scorer Rating Player Rankings</h2>

      <p>Off-Ball Scorer Rating (OBSR) is an offensive metric that uses play-type and tracking data to rank perimeter players by an estimation
        of their scoring contributions while off the ball.
      </p>


      <div id='table-container'></div>
    </div>
    <div id="Calculation" class="tabcontent">
      <h2>How Off-Ball Scorer Rating is calculated:</h2>

      <p>
          Off-Ball Scorer Rating (OBSR) is a composite of three off-ball components: scoring off screens,
          scoring off cuts, and scoring off spot-ups. Using publicly available tracking and playtype data, OBSR estimates a
          player's points/possession contribution in each component
          with respect to volume, efficiency, player movement, and player role and combines them into a single rating.



      </p>
      <h3 style="font-size:175%">Player-Role Adjustments:</h3>
      <p>
        Volume is very important in measuring off-ball ability. Players who frequently use their off-ball activity to create their own opportunities
          and put pressure on the defense should be rewarded more than players who idle on the perimeter - even if the latter are more efficient.
          One way of quantifying this is by using playtype frequencies (ie. how often a player cuts) and offensive player speed (how much a player moves on offense).
          However, the problem with simply using these raw values is that they disproportionately undervalue high-usage players for a couple of reasons. Firstly, players who spend more time off-the-ball will
          naturally have higher off-ball playtype frequencies than players who spend less time off-the-ball. Secondly, heavy-isolation scorers will have
          slower player speeds than less frequent isolation scorers. In both cases, these raw values are a greater reflection of a player's
          on-ball playing style than their off-ball abilities. Without adjustments, high-usage players who are also active off-the-ball, like Devin Booker and Jamal Murray, would be unfairly
          penalized for having ostensibly low off-ball activity.
      </p>

<p>
        The main way OBSR adjusts for these factors is by using tracking data to approximate the proportion of a possession
        that a player spends off-the-ball. Then, through a regression, OBSR estimates how active a player should be off-the-ball
        given the proportion of an average possession that they spend off-the-ball. Furthermore, OBSR also looks at
        isolation playtype data to give some leniency to players who's heavy-isolation tendencies tank their offensive speed stats.
        This adjusted-speed is utilized most in attempting to distinguish between players who are primarily stationary spot-up shooters (worth less) and players
        who are primarily relocation spot-up shooters (worth more) in the spot-up scoring component.
